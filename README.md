XEDA
====

Today XEDA is nothing, but maybe, in a few `years` (maybe), it is supposed to be a free EDA cross platform.

It's a multi platform EDA using 100% python with PySide and many others.

When I say it does nothing I really mean it. I just started with a few code lines.... :(

So don't wast your time check this out now.... if you need an EDA you can go with Eagle or, even better (IMHO), with KiCAD.
